# datomic.rb

Datomic is a distributed database designed to enable scalable, flexible and intelligent applications.
It is a database of flexible, time-based facts.
In this talk we will go through basics of Datomic, and the rationale behind it.
Weâ€™ll then look at how we can start using it from Ruby, using the rest-client, and conclude
with understanding how we can get Datomic to work with ActiveRecord Objects,
and use in Ruby on Rails with diametric.
